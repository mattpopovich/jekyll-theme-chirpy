## Intro
All right boys and girls, big day today in the crypto community. As the *legendary* trader, [Davey Day Trader Global](https://www.barstoolsports.com/shows/112/davey-day-trader) (DDTG) would say, "[emergency press conference](https://youtu.be/DEVMWo9Da44)"!

## something
Bitcoin just crashed 25% over the last two days (high of $58k on 2/21/21, low of $45k on 2/23/21). Some are saying *the sky is falling*, *[S.O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS)*, *[mayday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday)*, *R.I.P.*, *[I'm never going to financially recover from this](https://youtu.be/tH1cEtM4pbA)*. But I'm here to tell you that if you can stay the course, not panic, and \~\~*breathe*\~\~, things are going to be just fine. If this is something that you don't think you can routinely stomach, then maybe bitcoin's not for you. This is actually not too far out of the ordinary for bitcoin.

I'm also here to explain that I know next to nothing about money, finances, the economy, and I'm definitely **NOT** a certified financial planner. I'm really not even certified in anything for that matter. So, please do your own research before investing and listening to *[Joe Shmoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Shmoe)* off of YouTube (no offense to any Joe Shmoe's out there.. I'm sure you're all very knowledgeable people). What follows are strictly my opinions and I am going to elaborate on my thoughts (which are not recommendations). Let's go!

This post is mainly meant for someone who recently started to invest in crypto, although I think even people who have been in the space for could probably gain something from this. With that said, I've been following the space closely since ~2013 or so:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve been watching Bitcoin and Litecoin spiral all night...... <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/turnup?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#turnup</a></p>&mdash; Matt Popovich (@MattPopovich) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattPopovich/status/409230091064180736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To start things off, I'm going to throw out a few applicable quotes: 
- "[Past performance is no guarantee of future results](https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/past-performance-no-guarantee-future-results)" 
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
  - [Bert Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Lance#%22If_it_ain't_broke,_don't_fix_it%22)
- "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes"

In other words, what I'm trying to say is, there's no guarantee that these things will continue to happen, but, for now, they seem to be a good indicator. 

For starters, I am going to use the last bull market (late 2017 to $20k) to give us some insight into the current (2021) bull market. 



## Outro
That's the spiel, hopefully you found this interesting and/or insightful! 

Thank you for reading.
