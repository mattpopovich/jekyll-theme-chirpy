**Good evening, YouTube!**

## Intro

I was minding my own business this Sunday when [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) interrupted me with a notification (little bit of a sidebar, I was watching the [Netflix movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224), [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) this weekend... highly recommend), which I fell trap to, so I opened their app and began scrolling. After a quick peruse, I ran into this post, which looked... interesting. Note that it's a promoted post and I try to avoid these at all costs, but, against my own judgment, I began to read about this thing called "[Earth 2](https://earth2.io/)".

## What is Earth 2? 

To save you the time, *Earth 2* is basically a "company" that has decided it will duplicate the Earth into 10m x 10m = 100m^2 sections (The Earth divides into [5.1 trillion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=surface+area+of+earth+%2F+%2810*10%29+square+meters) 100m^2 sections for those math majors at home) and sell them as plots of land in a digital world. Eventually it sees augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) taking place in this "digital world". Possibly something similar to *[Second Life](https://secondlife.com/)*? But... cool... nothing terribly wrong with that. 

Where I began to have some red flags pop up is when, literally, in the first sentence of this promo I find *values are currently increasing at 1% an hour*... I'm no math major, but, 1% an hour is [~27% a day](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.01%5E24). If you continue compounding for a year, you will end up with [~7x10^39%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.01%5E%2824*365%29) (~7000000000000000000000000000000000000000%)........ Uhm, yeah, that's more money than there is [in the entire world](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+money+is+there+in+the+world&oq=how+much+money+is+there+in+the+world) (~1.2 quadrillion = ~1.2x10^15 = ~1200000000000000), and by a long shot. 

Well, now that we've got that unrealistic expectation out of the way... 

The post on Quora goes on to say that there's five sources of income for Earth 2. 
1. Land value: 
   - The price of land inside Earth 2 fluctuates from country to country. Each country starts at the very attractive price of $0.10 for 10mx10m of land. The value changes depending on trading price and demand per country giving you **potential opportunities to buy low and sell high**. 
     - (Conveniently this fails to mention the opportunity to buy *high* and sell *low*... Er, I guess, the mis-opportunity)
   - This trading platform is available and operational right now and is a potential way for early buyers to **earn big returns** on their land purchases. 
     - (just lol at *earn big returns*)
2. Land income tax: 
   - Tax, if I understand correctly, where you get a percentage of the sale of land in a country where you also own land. So, it sounds like the more people that use the game and buy land, the more you will make... Hmm. Sounds like you're being, almost, *paid* to recruit new users..? Hmm, let's see what's next. 
3. Referral system: 
   - Actually, you literally get paid to recruit new users (5% savings for you and 5% savings for them). 
     - Now, referral programs are very normal and there's not much harm with them to incentivize new users. For example, with Uber or DoorDash, etc. whoever you refer, they will normally offer ~10% off of their first order and you will also get ~10% off of your next order, etc. That's fine, that's sustainable. But, note that those companies don't give you 10% off of **all** of your orders **for life**. Which, Earth 2's referral system is "5% off of **all future purchases**". Yikes. But, at least they're not giving percentages for who your referrals refer, because that is the literal definition of a [pyramid scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme). 

Some other sources of income that will be available later... they require many things to go as planned, so for present-day purposes, they are not terribly relevant to this evaluation. 

## Common Earth 2 Talking Points

As I continued to research, a common theme that I saw is the comparison to other extremely risky and speculative assets. AKA "It happened once, it could happen again". While they're not *wrong*, they are tip-toeing down a slippery slope. The example in the Quora post is comparing Earth 2 to *[The Million Dollar Homepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage)*. The Million Dollar Homepage has one million pixels each for sale for $1 on its website. They are arranged in a 1000x1000 (= 1,000,000) grid. No foul play in this idea, but, note who got rich there. Was it the guy selling the pixels or was it the people buying them? 

Finally, to the conclusion of the Quora post....
