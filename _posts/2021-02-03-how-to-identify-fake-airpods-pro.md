**Top 'o the mornin', YouTube!**

## Intro
Matt here, just wanted to make a quick video on how to identify fake vs. real AirPods Pro. I ended up buying some fake ones off of Craigslist, and want to avoid others from doing the same. Let's jump right into it. 

Oh! Happy St. Patrick's Day, and, happy Tie Tuesday ðŸ‘”

(Ok, yes, I know.. It's not St. Patrick's Day and it's not even Tuesday. But, I first recorded this on St. Patrick's Day 2020 *which* fell on a Tuesday. So... better late than never? Moving on!)

## Visual Check
Getting down to business, there are three quick ways to check if you have genuine AirPods Pros. The easiest is to just take off the ear tips and see if you see a black oval speaker looking thing. That contains an inward facing microphone for more advanced noise cancellation.

However, being that AirPods Pros have been out for a little less than a year and a half now, fakes have gotten better and a black oval in the earpiece is no longer a guarantee that they are genuine. 

The next easiest thing is to just double check that the proximity sensor is on the bottom of the body, with a speaker grill on the inside of the body, and another diffuser on the outside of the body. All of which are black.

## Bluetooth Check
So, if the quick visual all checks out, the next quick-ish check will come from the settings app. First, you'll have to connect the AirPods Pros to your iPhone. Next, you'll want to go into *Settings*, then *General*, then *About*. If you scroll about halfway down, you should see a new, little menu available for your AirPods. If you have a fake pair of AirPods, I don't believe you will have that option. If you enter that menu, you'll see detailed information about your 'Pros. 

## Serial Number Check
The last quick check is to *validate that serial number*. Act like you're at the club on a Friday night and get those digits! (Sorry) You can find them either in the settings app as mentioned [above](#bluetooth-check) (in settings -> general -> about -> special little menu below "EID"), or you can get them from the top of the inside of the AirPods case, or from the outside of the box. There's also a number on the AirPods themselves, but it does not seem to be a unique identifier for them as it's different for each one and does not match their serial number... Anywho, you can pop that serial number into [checkcoverage.apple.com](https://checkcoverage.apple.com) and find out what Apple says. 

If you get a screen telling you "We're sorry, but we are unable to complete your request at this time. Please try again later", then you have been *[hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amok, and flat out deceived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B3gjf0sREk)*. If you think you do have a valid product, you could try and contact Apple at [getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com) as one last Hail Mary. 

What you should see is the below screen showing that you have a valid product.

Instead, you might see the screen below if you purchased from a third-party reseller and have yet to verify your purchase date.

Either of these two mean you are likely *\~\~gucci\~\~*, AKA good-to-go. 

## Outro
If your AirPods Pro pass that test, then they're probably legit. 

That's a wrap! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to comment below. 

That's all I've got, we'll see you around.
